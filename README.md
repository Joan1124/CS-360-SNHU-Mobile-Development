# CS-360-SNHU-Mobile-Development

Project Requirements:

Develop code that allows a user to log in. As you develop your code, use the Android Emulator feature of Android Studio to test your code. Your app should work for users that both do and do not have accounts. This means you should focus on the following functionality:
The app should check the username and password against the database when the user attempts to log in.
If the user has never logged into the application before, the user should be able to create a new login and password. The application needs to save these to a table in the database.
Develop code to create a database shell and display that database’s information on a user’s screen using a grid. The SQLLite database you create will depend on the option you selected in Project One and will store either inventory items, event details, or daily weight. Any information needed for your application to function correctly should be held in the database, but remember you are only creating the shell for the database so its contents can later be populated by a user. Note that you will need tables in the database to store user information when it is not being displayed in the grid. This database will be persistent so no user information is lost when the app is closed. Be sure to test your code often with the Android Emulator. Your completed database should allow a user to accomplish the following:
Create: The user should be able to add items to a database.
Delete: The user should be able to remove items from a database.
Update: The user should be able to change the value associated with individual database items (e.g. the number of a specific item in an inventory or the date of an event).
Read: The user should be able to view all of the database items displayed as a grid.
